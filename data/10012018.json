Working with Victorinox on one particular creative task every year has not only become an interesting ritual internally, it has also allowed us to directly compare results and discover how Victorinox has increased sales of their 130-year-old swiss army knife by 70% through crowdstorming on jovoto.\nThe second time jovoto organized the project for Victorinox, we believed that the increase in performance was a result from the overall community growth and improvements of the crowdstorming model over time. But after taking a closer look in the third year, we learned there was more to it: The relationships a brand forms with members of our community over time improve a projectís performance significantly.\n\nThe yearly project became a ritual not only for our team but also for many members of our community. Our creatives look forward to the next round as an inspiring challenge but also as a good way to apply learnings from the previous crowdstorm. The investment for each individual creative to participate becomes lower and lower after gaining experience in previous years . This not only increases participation quantity, but most importantly submission quality.\n\nFor Victorinox, the existing relationship with hundreds of creatives increases to pay off each round. The first year we organized the challenge to create a limited design edition for the Swiss Army Classic Knife, roughly 1 000 designs were submitted. The following year, Victorinox received 30% more submissions, and, most importantly, the quality increased and has continued to increase every year.","study_case_link":"https://www.jovoto.com/blog/business/maximizing-roi-working-external-communities/","study_case_pdf":"","has_logo":true,"comments":"","cluster":"5","attributes":{"process":{"aggregation_of_contributions":"selective","peer_contributions_accessibility":"assess","remuneration_for_contributions":"success_based","preselection_of_contributors":"none","form_of_remuneration":"market"},"goal":{"main_beneficiary":"initiator","value_type":"cost_reduction","input_tolerance":"high"},"task":{"type":"creation","dependencies":"decoupled","novelty":"novelty","effectiveness":"none"},"crowd":{"contribution_type":"content","main_motivational_driver":"tangible_reward"}},"status":"ok"}}

App users can get issue updates on the go, have the ability to comment on other issues reported nearby, and can elevate importance for various issues as necessary.

The vast majority of CS initiatives in this group are implemented according to the integrative sourcing without remuneration process (65%). The remainder initiatives use the selective sourcing with crowd assessment (17%) and integrative sourcing with fixed remuneration (13%) processes. If we consider only the aggregation of contributions dimension of the process, we see that integrative aggregation is clearly predominant in this group (83%)."}}
