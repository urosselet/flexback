The members are driven by social status and reputation in this community. The majority of CS initiatives in this group are implemented according to the integrative sourcing without remuneration process (53%), followed by selective sourcing with crowd assessment (21%) and integrative sourcing with success-based remuneration (21%) If we consider only the aggregation of contributions dimension of the process, we see that integrative aggregation is clearly predominant in this group (79%)."

A small share of these initiatives uses the integrative sourcing with fixed remuneration process (13%). If we consider only the aggregation of contributions dimension of the process, we see that integrative aggregation is clearly predominant in this group (83%)."

It is characterized by the willingness to reduce costs by entrusting decoupled content creation tasks for a tangible reward to the crowd. CS initiatives in this group are mainly implemented in three forms of CS processes: integrative sourcing with fixed remuneration (37%), selective sourcing with crowd assessment (31%) and selective sourcing without crowd assessment (31%). If we consider only the aggregation of contributions dimension of the process, we see that there is a slight favor towards selective (60%) versus integrative (40%) aggregation in this group."

A small share of these initiatives relies on the integrative sourcing without remuneration process (14%). If we consider only the aggregation of contributions dimension of the process, we see that integrative aggregation is clearly predominant in this group (76%)."
